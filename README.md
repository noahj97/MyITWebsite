<h4>Interest in IT</h4>
<p>My interest in IT has always been apparent. Growing up with a father who was an architect I was always surrounded by computers and technology at home. Luckily enough I also had a father who was interested in gaming so growing up I had access to an N64 and a desktop PC which has planted some fond memories in my gaming life. For example, beating The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time at an early age and playing Star Wars Pod Racing on the computer with a joystick.</p>
<p> This interest in gaming has carried on well into my adult life, in College I built my first computer, and I was hooked. That then spiraled into hours of research on how all the hardware and software worked in conjunction to bring us the computers we have today. I became the friend that was the go-to when building computers and to date have built around 30+ computers for family and friends.</p>
<p>  This year I decided to sign up with RMIT to hopefully achieve my bachelor's degree in information technology first starting with this course and with this, hope to secure a job as a software developer to hopefully design something that will change people's lives!</p>
<p> During my studies I hope to become fluent in multiple coding languages, become familiar with different creation environments and overall, just become more aware of the effect technology has on our lives whether it be positive or negative.</p>

<h4>Ideal Job</h4>
<p> My dream job in the IT field would be a software programmer of sorts.</p>
